##Purpose of module

Monogo\Weather is a module which responsible for show current weather in selected region.

##Possibilities

Monogo\Weather have following possibilities:
* Display weather
* Set up in admin area api key, region, translation API request, unit, and refresh
* Scroll all rows in `adminhtml`

##Testing
Regarding to integration tests for webapi I can't test the case when data weather 
are added  to db because I wouldn't like share webapi key which is sensitive data. 
It's not good practise to share for everyone my private key to api. I tested only erorr case.
